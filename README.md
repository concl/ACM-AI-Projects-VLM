# ACM-AI-Projects-VLM
VLM implementation from scratch using PyTorch.

# Timeline:

## Week 3 (intro to project)
Meeting: Introduce VLMs with slides, Go into the architecture that we will be using briefly (more in depth on vision encoder, Get started on the model with the vision encoder

Async: Try to understand vision encoder concepts, how to implement, come with questions
## Week 4
Meeting: Fill in incomplete code, transition to the text encoder, have in depth presentation on text encoder

Async: Try to understand text encoder concepts, how to implement, come with questions
## Week 5
Meeting: Catch up on incomplete code, start on training loop and inference code

Async: Train your model fully
## Week 6 (minimum product)
Milestone 1: Perform various tasks with the VLM
visual question answering
image captioning
OCR

## Week 7
Meeting: Go into more extra sophisticated topics depending on member preferences
instruction tuning (as a concept)
fine-tuning techniques
prompt tuning, frozen encoders, supervised, etc
in depth understanding of reasoning of VLMs including our model
more complex ways to improve the VLM
something of their own volition (more research like)

Async: Finish up the above
## Week 8
Milestone 2: Discuss techniques, OH for finishing their model
## Week 9
(making report)
Make the presentation for Cyber Symposium
